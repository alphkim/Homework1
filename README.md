# Leaf Global Fintech: digital wallets and mobile money for refugee

## Overview and Origin

Blockchain technology with its distributed ledger, decentralized administration, and secure cryptography presents an opportunity to provide affordable financial services to refugees crossing through multiple countries.

Refugees and other displaced persons are often at risk of criminal activity as a result of carrying cash, and physical currency is especially difficult to safely store and transport across borders. Leaf Global Fintech integrated financial services provides individuals with virtual banking services to vulnerable populations crossing borders.

Leaf is a social enterprise headquartered in Nashville, Tennesse with companies in Rwanda and DR Congo. It was incorporated in 2007 and founded by Tori Samples and Nat Robinson who both have extensive experience in microfinance, blockchain, refugee crisis management, and mobile technology. 

For the 68.5 million forcibly displaced people in the world today and the 100 million people who could become refugees tomorrow, access to financial services is crucial. Personal savings and access to friends and family willing to help is often the only lifeline. Leaf safeguard their money and provide access across borders, helping refugees with financial security, and a greater chance of success in a new country.

## Business Activities

Leaf created a platform to efficiently receive transfers, store savings, and make payments to help increase refugees’ access to funds and decrease their dependence on host countries and foreign aid. Limited technology and physical infrastructure during transit and in refugee camps necessitate innovative solutions to ensure that refugees and internally displaced persons can participate in the formal economy. 

Using blockchain technology and a low-tech front end to create a safe and secure system for individuals to store assets, receive payments, and make cross-border transfers, Leaf' suite of products works on any mobile device—no smartphone required, providing easier access to vulnerable populations. By using blockchain to facilitate digital payments, customers avoid unnecessarily high transaction costs charged by traditional money transfer companies. Customer can access Leaf’s digital wallet wherever they go and receive deposits from friends and family abroad straight to their mobile device. Refugees and migrants can journey without cash, knowing accounts are safe and accessible globally. 

Leaf converts mobile money through blockchain technology into stable investments. Value is not stored in cryptocurrency so that refugees are hedged against volatility. Leaf uses that stored value to make secure investments that generate income for the company. It can also profit from small transaction fees and a positive foreign exchange spread. Rather than charging excessive fees to their users or exposing them to risk, Leaf is able to safely and securely make income from value stored on the platform. 

Leaf Global Fintech has raised a total of $100K in funding over 2 rounds by 2 impact investors:
1. Catalyst Fund 
2. Western Union Accelerator Powered by Techstars

## Landscape

Traditional banking institutions have been unable or unwilling to provide financial products to refugees, thus providing an opening for companies like Leaf to improve the financial livelihoods of these forcibly displaced persons. 

The United Nations Development Programme singled out digital wallets and mobile money to fight poverty by providing a quick and inexpensive way of receiving remittances, building savings without a bank account, paying for services, and accepting public assistance.

In the same social enterprising domain of blockchain and financial services, another company, Ripple, helped cut the time it takes to send remittances to developing countries from days to seconds, and reducing the cost from as high as 10% to fractions of a penny. 

## Results

Leaf is currentlly proving its model across Africa and intends on expanding globally to other migration corridors such as South America and Southeast Asia.

Resettled refugees have already advocated Leaf' services to friends and family living in conflict zones around the world. With this network and the 250+ individuals testing/piloting, Leaf already has an established base of adopters in US, Rwanda and Congo.
